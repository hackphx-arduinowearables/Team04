Our project, also appropriately referred to as *The Google Glass Killer*, uses the following components components:

- Xadow
- 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer ADXL345
- OLED Display (128x64)
- Addressable RGB LED strip
- Ping sensor

## Functionality

Moving the head unit around raises your power level, which is shown on the internal display. LEDs on the outside of the head unit indicate the power level, 1 LED per 1000 power, and blinking red when *over 9000*.

## Design

The head unit uses reflective technology for the display, solving the human eye focal limitations and keeping the unit from extending too far in front of the face.

A stenciled image of a human face was applied to the front of the head unit to help it blend in with the user.

## Budget

We managed to stick to parts found in the lab, in addition to the parts provided to us. Our out-of-pocket cost was $0.00 USD.
